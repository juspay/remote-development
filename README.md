### Deploying `vanjaram`

Currently, we are managing a single NixOS machine called `vanjaram`. It does not use disko (see section below) yet. This is how we update its configuration:

```
# SSH to vanjaram (via tailscale)
ssh {srid|remotedev}@vanjaram
> cd /etc/nixos
# ^ This points to this git repository
> sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

Make sure to push your changes to Git. Later, we want to figure out remote deployment here.
