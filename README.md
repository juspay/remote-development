# remote-development

[NixOS](https://nixos.asia/en/nixos) configuration for shared remote [development](https://nixos.asia/en/dev) via SSH

## Getting started

### Deploying `vanjaram`

Currently, we are managing a single NixOS machine called `vanjaram` (IP address `10.10.71.148`). It does not use disko. This is how we update its configuration:

```
# SSH to vanjaram (via tailscale)
ssh srid@vanjaram
> cd /etc/nixos
# ^ This points to this git repository
> nix run
# ^ This runs 'nixos-rebuild switch' (via nixos-flake)
```

Make sure to push your changes to Git. Later, we want to figure out remote deployment here (as with `github:juspay/nixos-buffet`).

## Adding users

1. If your Juspay email address is `myname@juspay.in`, add yourself to `users/myname.nix`. See `users/srid.nix` for example. Then open a PR.
